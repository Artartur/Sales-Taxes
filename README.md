Setup:

    To run the project, you will need:
        IntelliJ
        Java JDK 8
        Git and Github (if you are cloning the repository or downloading the project from there)
        Some software to unzip folders (if you download from GitHub)
        Add classpath Junit on the IntelliJ

Run:

    Open the project in IntelliJ.
    Go to src/View/Main.java.
    Press Shift + F10 (If the executor is already configured, the program will run).
    If nothing happens, the executor is probably not configured yet. To configure it:
        Go to the dropdown on the left side of the green hammer.
        Press Alt + Insert.
        Choose "Application" under "Build and run".
        Click on the blank space that is outlined in red on the border.
        Select "Main".
        Click "OK".
        Click "Apply".
        Press Shift + F10, and the program will run.

Run Test:

    To set it up:
        Go to Test/Controller/ExemptProductsTest or Test/Model/Test
        Go to the dropdown on the left side of the green hammer.
        Press Alt + Insert.
        Choose "JUnit".
        You can put a name if you want.
        Just below the name, there is the Java version, and next to it is a configuration. Do not mess with this part.
        In the part further down, choose the class option if you want to run all the tests of a class.
        If you want to run the test only of each method, choose the method option.
        If your option was class in the side field, choose the desired option.
        Click "OK".
        Click "Apply".
        You can close and then press Shift + F10 (remember to change the executor).
        If your choice was method, in the field beside, choose a class option and in the following, the method that belongs to the chosen class.
        Click "OK".
        Click "Apply".
        You can close and then press Shift + F10 (remember to change the executor).
